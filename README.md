The final project for GWC Granada 2024, a tile-based puzzle and adventure game using processing.py from trinket.io

To run it, you'll want to load it into trinket.io (the "main" trinket is https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/e8b724cab0).

To add your own contributions, you'll want to fork this repo in github (make sure you're logged in, then find the fork button in the top-right) and follow the instructions to create your own copy! Paste your altered trinket into main.py, overwriting its current contents--git is smart enough to figure out what changed. Commit that and, if you like, merge it back! We'll walk through an example.
